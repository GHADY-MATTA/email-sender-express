✅ PART 1: Set Up Your Gmail for Nodemailer
Google doesn’t allow logging in with your Gmail password from third-party apps like Nodemailer — but it does allow App Passwords, which are safer and made just for this.

🔐 Step-by-Step to Get a Gmail App Password
1. ✅ Enable 2-Step Verification
Go to: https://myaccount.google.com/security

Scroll down to "Signing in to Google"

Enable 2-Step Verification

🧠 Required before you can generate app passwords

2. ✅ Generate an App Password
After 2FA is enabled, go to:
👉 https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords

Log in if prompted

Under "Select app": choose Mail

Under "Select device": choose Other → type NodeMailer

Click Generate

✅ You’ll get a 16-character password like:

nginx

abcd efgh ijkl mnop
🔐 Copy this and store it. You will NOT see it again.

✅ PART 2: Add to Your Project
1. Create .env in your project root:

EMAIL_USER=yourgmail@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=abcd efgh ijkl mnop   # <== NO SPACES
PORT=3000
⚠️ Important: remove any spaces from the copied password when adding it to .env, like:


EMAIL_PASS=abcdefghijklmnop
2. Use in your mailer.js
Already correct in your code:


const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
  service: "gmail",
  auth: {
    user: process.env.EMAIL_USER,
    pass: process.env.EMAIL_PASS
  }
});
Nodemailer will now authenticate with that Gmail App Password.

✅ PART 3: Final Checklist
Task	Status
Gmail has 2-Step Verification	✅ Required
Gmail App Password generated	✅ One-time setup
.env file created with credentials	✅ Do not share this file
mailer.js uses EMAIL_USER/PASS	✅ Best practice

✅ Example Final .env (DO NOT SHARE PUBLICLY)

EMAIL_USER=myacc123@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your16characterapppass
PORT=3000
🧪 To Test It
Run the server:


node server.js
Send POST request via curl or Postman:


{
  "email": "yourdestination@gmail.com",
  "password": "999888"
}
Your Gmail will send an email to the destination using the template.

🔴 Open Postman
Method: POST

URL: https://5a3d-123-456-789-abc.ngrok.io/send

⚠️ DO NOT include /server.js in the URL — you're POSTing to the /send route.

4. 🟡 Set the Headers
Go to the Headers tab in Postman and make sure this exists:

Key	Value
Content-Type	application/json

5. 🔵 Set the JSON Body
Switch to the Body tab → choose raw → set format to JSON.

Paste this JSON:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "email": "yourtestemail@gmail.com",
  "password": "483920"
}
Replace yourtestemail@gmail.com with an address you can check.
